## Dataset 
Raw Data-<a href="https://github.com/Hemachandran007/Sales-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Chocolate%20Sales%20(2).csv">

I worked with a raw sales dataset and performed end to end data analysis using MySQL and Power BI.

I started by cleaning the data in MySQL removing currency symbols, correcting date formats, and converting text fields into proper numeric and date types using functions like REPLACE(), STR_TO_DATE(), and CAST(). This made the dataset ready for analysis.

After preparing the data, I imported it into Power BI and used Power Query and DAX to create key KPIs such as Total Sales, Total Boxes Shipped, Average Order Value, and Sales per Box.

**then built an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard to analyze**:
Sales by Country
Sales by Product
Sales by Salesperson
Sales trends over time
Slicers and filters were added to make the dashboard dynamic and user friendly for business decision making.

**Business Objective**:
To monitor and analyze sales performance by country, product, and salesperson over time to support data driven decisions.

Tools Used: **MySQL, Power BI, Excel**
Skills Applied: *Data Cleaning, SQL, Data Transformation, DAX, Dashboard Design, Data Visualization*
